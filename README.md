# Stock-analysis
#Overview of Project: In this project we used VBA, Excel's programming langugae in order to create a macro that helps us analyze a set of data easily. When we run the macro we created we can determine the return of any stock and decide if we want to invest in it. 

#Results:

As we can see every stock in the year 2017 had a good performance except 'TERP'which had a negative return of -7.2%. Nonetheless, next year was not great for the market. 
As we can see in the table only 'ENPH' and 'RUN' had a positive return with a value of 81.9% and 84%, respecteviley.

According to the performance test we ran, we can see that the original code that we wrote runs faster with a time of 0.09 seconds. Our refracted code ran in a time of 0.10 seconds.

##Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
